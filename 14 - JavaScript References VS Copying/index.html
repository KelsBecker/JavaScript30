    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //this will only change the original, name2 is a copy and remains unchanged
    let name = 'Kelly'
    let name2 = name
    console.log('name:', name, 'name2:', name2)
    name = 'Lynny'
    console.log('name:', name, 'name2:', name2)
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const people = players
    console.log('Players:', players,'People:', people)

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // this changes the people array and the players array
    // because people is simply a reference to players...not a copy
    people[2] = 'Joey'
    console.log('Players:', players,'People:', people)

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    people2 = players.slice()
    console.log('Players:', players, 'People2:', people2)
    people2[3] = 'Morgan'
    console.log('Players:', players, 'People2:', people2)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    people3 = [].concat(players)
    console.log('Players:', players, 'People3:', people3)
    people3[0] = 'Eric'
    console.log('Players:', players, 'People3:', people3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // can also use const someVariable = Array.from(players) also makses a copy
    const people4 = [...players]
    console.log('Players:', players, 'People4:', people4)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    people4[3] = 'Kelly'
    console.log('Players:', players, 'People4:', people4)
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // this is just a reference
    const badassWoman = person
    badassWoman.name = 'Kelly'
    console.log('Person Object:', person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const me = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 32})
    console.log('Person Object:', person, 'Me Object:', me)

    //object ...spread
    const meToo = {...person}
    console.log('Person Object:', person, 'MeToo Object:', meToo)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const kelly = {
      name: 'Kelly',
      age: 32,
      social: {
        twitter: '@lynnymeister',
        linkedIn: 'kelly.developer'
      }
    };
  //this changes both the kelly object linkedIn and kellyB object linkedIn
  //because its a shallow copy and only goes one level deep
    const kellyB = Object.assign({}, kelly)
    console.log(kellyB)
    kellyB.social.linkedIn = 'kelly.lynn'
    console.log('Kelly:', kelly, 'KellyB', kellyB)

  //poor mans deep clone
  //will only change kellyBecker
  //not very performant
  let kellyBecker = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(kelly))
  kellyBecker.social.linkedIn = 'kelly.lynn.becker'
  console.log(kellyBecker)
